6. String Concatenation 
   - What do you think will happen when you type "Hello" + 5*10 into the console?
   - implicit type coercion: You've just discovered some peculiar behavior in JavaScript. Itâ€™s called implicit type coercion and it's a feature of JavaScript. JavaScript multiplies the 5*10 to become 50 and then changes the number 50 into the string "50", so you're adding together the same data type. This then gets combined with the string "Hello". You'll learn more about why this happens later in this lesson.
