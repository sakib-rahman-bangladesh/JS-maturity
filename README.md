(Maturity) Interactive Web and Mobile User Interface development
---------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a reference project where I am trying to demonstrate past experiences and guideline how to develop and manage **complex UI interaction**, **transition animation** and **real time notifications** and **messaging** as well as keep the code always **manageable: easy to read, ready to change, safe from bugs** for further development.

Rapid user interfaces Development and look & feel for Web, Android, iPhone are main challenges which needs to be overcome. We overcome these challenges by choosing set of tools and programming language that equally works for web, mobile development and mastering on it.

In order to create user experience, We use to work with **React** and **React Native** for **Android** and **iPhone native UI development**. I have adopted functional style of programming with **immutable ds:** data structure (**Redux, GrapthQL**).

CSS, HTML5, SVG, Canvas are essential part of UI look & feet and also for make the UI responsive but one need to take special care when using these technologies spatially when using CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries. Which often makes website bulky slower loading time and slower response time. I used dead code elimination techniques using google Clojure compiler so that web site never gets bulky.

Data Visualization i.e info graphics is very important part of user interface design which empowers user so that user can understand whole business case at a glance. We have used d3 and Vega as well as mathematics when convenient in our projects.
